<h2>Flight Manager</h2>
<p>Allow a customer to choose a one way ticket between airports from around the world. Charges initial $50 fee and 11 cents per mile. The distance formula calculates for a sphereical object and since the Earth is not quite a sphere most distances will be about 1-20 miles off.</p>

<p>This program integrates knockout.js to create a dynamic UI that doesn't refresh at each selection. I also added a second page to display the flight plans that have been saved to the database.</p>
